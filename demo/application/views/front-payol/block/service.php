Aadhaar is a unique 12-digit identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to residents of India.</p>
                                          <p class="mt-1">AEPS allows individuals to access basic banking services such as cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, fund transfers, and other transactions using their Aadhaar number and biometric authentication, which can include fingerprints or iris scans. It eliminates the need for physical cards, documents, or signatures, making transactions more convenient and secure. The AEPS system is interoperable across different banks and service providers, enabling individuals to access their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts through any AEPS-enabled outlet or bank branch. It also facilitates the direct transfer of government benefits, subsidies, and pensions to beneficiaries' Aadhaar-linked bank accounts, ensuring timely and transparent disbursement of funds.</p>

                                          <p class="mt-5">A Micro ATM (MATM) is a handheld device that functions as a mini-branch of a bank, allowing individuals to perform basic banking transactions in locations where traditional banking infrastructure is limited or inaccessible. It is a portable and compact version of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that brings banking services closer to the people, especially in rural and remote areas. Micro ATMs are equipped with features that enable individuals to carry out various banking activities, such as cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, fund transfers, and bill payments. These devices are typically operated by a business correspondent or agent of the bank, who acts as an intermediary between the bank and the customers.</p>
                                          <p class="mt-1">To use a Micro ATM, individuals can authenticate themselves using methods like their debit card, Aadhaar number, or biometric identification. The device connects to the bank's network and allows users to access their bank accounts and perform transactions securely.</p>
                                          <p class="mt-1">The primary purpose of Micro ATMs is to facilitate financial inclusion by extending banking services to underserved and unbanked populations. These devices eliminate the need for individuals to travel long distances to access banking services and provide a convenient and accessible alternative.</p>
                                          <p class="mt-1">Micro ATMs are typically battery-powered and equipped with features like a card reader, fingerprint scanner, keypad, and display screen. They are designed to be user-friendly and require minimal technical expertise to operate.</p>

                                        <p class="mt-1">QR ATM, also known as QR Code-enabled ATM, is a type of automated teller machine that allows users to initiate transactions by scanning a QR code using their Smartphone  or other mobile devices. It eliminates the need for physical cards and enables users to access banking services through a digital platform. With QR ATMs, users can scan a QR code displayed on the ATM screen using their mobile device's camera or a QR code scanning app. This initiates a connection between the user's mobile device and the ATM, enabling them to perform various transactions such as cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and bill payments.</p>
                                          <p class="mt-1">The QR code contains information that identifies the transaction type and the user's account details. Once the QR code is scanned, the user can select the desired transaction on their mobile device, provide any necessary authentication such as a PIN or biometric verification, and confirm the transaction. The ATM processes the transaction and completes the requested operation accordingly.</p>
